🛍️ Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning (K-Means Clustering)

This project performs Customer Segmentation using the K-Means Clustering algorithm.
It groups mall customers based on Annual Income and Spending Score, helping businesses understand customer behavior and make data-driven marketing decisions.

This project was created as part of my Machine Learning Summer Internship.

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on similar characteristics.
In this project, I used unsupervised learning to cluster customers into meaningful segments.

Machine Learning Technique Used
K-Means Clustering

An unsupervised machine learning algorithm:

Groups data into k clusters
Finds patterns based on similarity
Works best for customer grouping
